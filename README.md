# Mouse Highlighter Proof of Concept

This project builds a standalone executable to serve as a proof of concept for a new mouse utility for [PowerToys](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerToys) to highlight left and right clicks the user makes. This can be useful to indicate mouse action when doing a screen share.

## Usage

- Build `MouseHighlighter.sln` and run `MouseHighlighter.exe`.
- Press `Win`+`Shift`+`H` to activate/deactivate.
- While activated, left-clicking and right-clicking will create semi-transparent circles that disappear after a while.
- Press `Ctrl`+`Win`+`Shift`+`H` to exit the application.
